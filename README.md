 #Full Stack Registration Form Project

## Overview

This project is a full-stack web application that implements a user registration form. The application is built using HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. The goal is to create a seamless and secure user registration process, storing user information in a MongoDB database.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML and CSS**: The front end of the application is built with HTML for structuring the web pages and CSS for styling.

- **Node.js**: The server-side logic is implemented using Node.js, providing a JavaScript runtime environment.

- **Express.js**: Express.js is used as the web application framework for Node.js, simplifying the process of handling HTTP requests and responses.

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is employed as the database system for storing user registration data. It offers a flexible and scalable NoSQL database solution.

## Tools and Libraries

- **[Express Validator](https://express-validator.github.io/docs/)**: Used for validating and sanitizing user input on the server-side.

- **[Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)**: A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js, used for interacting with the MongoDB database in an easier way.

- **[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv)**: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

## Features

1. **User Registration Form**: The application provides a user-friendly registration form where users can enter their information.

2. **Validation**: Client-side and server-side validation mechanisms ensure that the entered data is accurate and secure.

3. **Database Storage**: User registration details are securely stored in a MongoDB database, allowing for efficient retrieval and management.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
 -->  ```bash
   
 --> git clone https://github.com/varshakodati/registration-form.git
   
2.**Install dependencies**: 

 --> cd registration-form
   
 --> npm install

3.**Configure MongoDB connection**:

 --> Create a .env file in the root directory.

 --> Add your MongoDB connection string as MONGODB_URI.

4.**start the application**:

 --> npm start

## Deployment

This project is designed to be hosted on [Render](https://render.com/). Follow these steps to deploy the project:

1.Create an account on Render.

2.Initialize a Git repository if not already done.

--> git init

3.Create a new web service on Render:

--> Connect your GitHub repository to Render.

--> Set up environment variables, including the MongoDB URI.

4.Deploy the application:

--> Render will automatically build and deploy your application when changes are pushed to the connected repository.

5.Open the deployed app using the provided URL.

--> Adjust the instructions based on the specific hosting/rendering platform you've used. Replace "your-mongodb-uri" with the actual MongoDB connection string and include any platform-specific details.


## Result:

The registration form application successfully captures user data and stores it in a MongoDB database. Validation mechanisms ensure the integrity of the data, providing a secure and user-friendly experience.

## Future Work:

n future iterations, the project can be enhanced with the following features:

User Authentication: Implement user authentication to secure user accounts.

Profile Management: Allow users to manage their profiles and update information.

Email Verification: Add an email verification step to enhance account security.

Improved UI/UX: Enhance the user interface and experience for a more polished look and feel.

Additional Form Fields: Expand the registration form with additional fields based on project requirements.
